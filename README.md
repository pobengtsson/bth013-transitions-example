# incrementing-numbers

This is examples of use of useTransition from vueuse.

The first (and currently only) example, shows how you can implement a incrementing/decrementing effect when numbers are set.
For example, if the value of a number starts at 100 and it is changed to 333, this example will create an transition where the number is incremented stepwise during 1 second, until it reaches the new set value.
